WHAT PROBLEM DOES THIS SOLVE
- When you're exporting a file from a program (photoshop, blender, whatever) it's really annoying to constantly be searching folders for the destination. This is really slow.
- Instead just set up autoMover paths and export everything to some simple path like "C:/Temp" with a prefix like "t_" and let the program send the files to the provided locations

USECASE EXAMPLES
- exporting textures from photoshop ->
  - save texture as "t_texture.jpg" to "C:/Temp"
  - press move to in autoMover to just send to desired destination path

- exporting model from blender ->
  - save character model as "c_somecharacter.fbx" to "C:/Temp"
  - press move to in autoMover to just send to desired destination path

HOW TO USE 
- To download check out "releases" at the right and un-zip the contents to a folder. (autoMover.exe and automover_settings.json should be in the same folder)
- Add a prefix like "prfx_poopoo" and destination for file like "C:/Destination"
- Press move files to move!
- OR toggle on "Auto Update" and it will automatically move the files
- you can add as many prefix options you like
- you can choose to remove the prefix after moving
